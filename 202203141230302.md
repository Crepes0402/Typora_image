Data granularity（信息颗粒度）:Refers to the extent of detail within the data (fine and detailed  or coarse and abstract). (细则是越多细节，粗则是更加抽象)
*<u>`Data type, Data timeliness, Data quality, Data government`</u>*

**1)Data Type: TRANSACTIONAL AND ANALYTICAL**

 Transactional data : Encompasses  all of the data contained within a single business process or unit of work, and its primary  purpose is to support daily operational tasks.

<u>Analytical data</u>: Encompasses all organizational data, and its primary purpose is to support  the performing of managerial analysis tasks.

交易数据（初始数据）经过分析后得到分析性数据，当需要检查数据不止一次是，将交易数据转换为分析性数据显得略有必要

**2)Data Timeliness**

Timeliness is an aspect of information  that depends on the situation.
<u>Real-time information</u>: Immediate, up-to-date information
<u>Real-time system</u>: Provides real-time information in response to requests

**3)Data Quality**

Data  inconsistency: Occurs when the same data element has different values.
Data integrity:  It is a  measure of the quality of data

The <u>Characteristics of High-quality information</u>: Accurate（精准性）, Complete（完整性）, Consistent（一致性）, Unique（独一无二）, Timely（时效性）

<u>The four primary sources of low quality information:</u>

1) Customers intentionally enter inaccurate  information to protect their privacy （数据输入
2) Different entry standards and formats（数据收集工具
3) Operators enter abbreviated or erroneous  information by accident or to save time（数据输入人
4) Third party and external information  contains inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and  errors

**4)Data Governanc5e**



### 6.2  Storing Data Using a Relational Database  Management System

<u>Database</u>: Maintains information  about various types of objects  (inventory), events (transactions),  people (employees), and places  (warehouses).

<u>Database management systems (DBMS)</u>: Allows  users to create, read, update, and delete data in a  relational database.

<u>Data element</u>: The smallest or  basic unit of information

<u>Data model</u>: Logical data  structures that detail the  relationships among data  elements using graphics or  pictures

<u>Metadata</u>: Details about data

<u>Data dictionary</u>: Compiles all  of the metadata about the data  elements in the data model

**Storing Data Elements In Entities and Attributes**

<u>Entity</u> : A person, place, thing,  transaction, or event about which  information is stored

<u>Attribute (field, column)</u>: The data  elements associated with an entity

<u>Record</u> :A collection of related data  elements

Creating Relationships Through Keys

<u>Primary key</u>: A field (or group of fields)  that uniquely identifies a given entity in a  table

<u>Foreign key</u>: A primary key of one table  that appears an attribute in another table  and acts to provide a logical relationship  among the two tables

**Advantages of Using a Relational Database** 

Increase flexibility（灵活性）: Handle changes quickly and easily, provide users with different views,  have only one physical view, have multiple logical views(逻辑视图，单个用户逻辑访问满足自身特定要求的信息业务)

Increase scalability and performance（可拓展性和性能）:A database must scale to meet  increased demand(scalability),  while  maintaining acceptable performance  levels

Increase information integrity(信息完整性）

Increase information security（信息安全性）: Password ,Access level ,Access control

Decrease information redundancies（信息冗余）:The duplication of data or  storing the same information  in multiple places



## Ch.7 Accessing Organizational Information Data Warehouse

> ​	1.Describe the roles and purposes of data  warehouses and data marts in an organization
>
> ​	2.Identify the advantages of using business  intelligence to support managerial decision  making
>

#### 7.1.1 The Problem

Data rich, information poor

#### 7.1.2 The Solution

Make data aggregation

<u>Dataset</u> : is an organized collection of  data.
<u>Comparative analysis</u> : can compare two or more datasets to identify patterns and trends.
<u>Data-driven decision management</u> : is an approach to business governance  that values decisions that can be backed up with verifiable data. 

#### 7.2 Data Warehousing: Supporting Decisions  with Business Intelligence

<u>Source data</u> : identifies the primary location where data is collected. Source data can include  invoices, spreadsheets, time sheets, transactions, and electronic sources such as other databases. 
<u>Raw data</u> : is data that has not been processed for use. Raw data that has undergone  processing is sometimes referred to as cooked data.
<u>Data aggregation</u> : is the collection of data from various sources for the purpose of data processing.

##### 7.2.1 Data Warehouse

![image-20220311090618308](../../../AppData/Roaming/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20220311090618308.png)

<u>A data warehouse</u> : is a logical collection of data—gathered from many different operational  databases—that supports business analysis activities and decision-making tasks. The primary  purpose of a data warehouse is to combine data, more specifically, strategic data, throughout an  organization into a single repository in such a way that the people who need that data can make  decisions and undertake business analysis. 

There are three layers to a data warehouse

1. <u>ETL or integration layer</u> : Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) is a process that  extracts data from internal and external databases, transforms it using a common set of  enterprise definitions, and loads it into a data warehouse. 

2. <u>Data warehouse layer</u> : This layer stores the data from every source system over time. The  data warehouse is designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing  and stores data from source systems and external systems. 
2. <u>Data mart layer</u> : A data mart contains a subset of data warehouse data. To distinguish  between data warehouses and data marts, think of data warehouses as having a more organizational focus and data marts as having a functional focus. Imagine a marketing representative requiring data from production, sales, and weather reports. This person would not  typically have access to these operational or source systems. The data warehouse can pull  the data from the source systems, cleanse it, and compile it in a data mart for the marketing  representative to analyze.

<u>Data cube</u> : is the common term for the representation of multidimensional data.

#### 7.2.2 Data Lake

<u>Data lake</u> : is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its original format  until the business needs it.

#### 7.2.3 Data Cleansing or scrubbing

<u>Information cleansing or scrubbing</u> ： A process  that weeds out and fixes or discards inconsistent,  incorrect, or incomplete information.

<u>Dirty data</u> : is erroneous or flawed data.(Inaccurate Data, Duplicate Date, Misleading Data, Incorrect Data, Nonformatted Data, Violates Business Rules Data, Nonintegrated)

## CH.8 Understanding Data’s  Impact on Business

> 1. Identify the four common characteristics of big  data. 
> 2. Explain data mining and identify the three  elements of data mining. 
> 3. Explain the importance of data analytics and data  visualization

(Big data can help an  organization analyze  petabytes for data for  patterns, trends, and  anomalies)

<u>Big data</u> : A collection of large, complex data  sets, including structured and unstructured data,  which cannot be analyzed using traditional  database methods and tools and includes the  following four common characteristics.

» Variety » Veracity » Volume » Velocity » Value

<u>Distributed computing</u> : Processes and  manages algorithms across many machines in a  computing environment

<u>Virtualization</u> : Creation of a virtual version of  computing resources, such as an operating system, a  server, a storage device, or network resource

### 8 Data mining

<u>Data mining</u> : The process of analyzing data to extract  information not offered by the raw data alone
<u>Data-mining tools</u> : Use a variety of techniques to find  patterns and relationships in large volumes of  information 

#### 8.1 Data Analysis :

Databases contain information in a series of  two-dimensional tables. In a data warehouse and data mart, information  is multidimensional, it contains layers of  columns and rows. 
<u>Dimension</u> : A particular attribute of information. 
<u>Cube</u> : Common term for the representation of  multidimensional information.![image-20220311093647263](C:\Users\Crepes\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220311093647263.png)

 （聚合—响应—探索）

#### 8.2 Data Visualization

<u>Data visualization</u> : describes technologies that allow users to see or visualize data to transform information into a business perspective.

<u>Data  visualization tools</u> : move beyond Excel graphs and charts into sophisticated analysis techniques  such as controls, instruments, maps, time-series graphs, and more. 

<u>Infographics (information graphics)</u> : Present  the results of data analysis, displaying the patterns, relationships, and trends in a graphical format.

<u>Data artist</u> : is a business analytics specialist who uses visual tools to help people understand complex data.

<u>Analysis paralysis</u> : Occurs when the user goes into an emotional state of over analysis (or  overthinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the  outcome.

<u>Business intelligence dashboards</u> : track corporate metrics such as critical success factors and  key performance indicators and include advanced capabilities such as interactive controls.

## B9 Business Intelligence

> 1. Compare tactical, operational, and strategic BI. 
> 2. Explain how data mining can help improve business process. 
> 3. Describe the four categories of BI business benefits.

<u>Business intelligence (BI)</u> : Applications and  technologies used to gather, provide access to, and  analyze data and information to support decisionmaking efforts. 
			Collecting information
			Discerning patterns and meaning in the information
			Responding to the resultant information

 <u>Data latency</u> : Is the time duration to make data ready for analysis (i.e., the time for  extracting, transforming, and cleansing the data) and loading the data into the database. 

<u>Analysis latency</u> : is the time from which data are made available to the time when analysis  is complete.

<u>Decision latency</u> : is the time it takes a human to comprehend the analytic result and  determine an appropriate action.
